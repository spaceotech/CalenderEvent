Recently, while working on a client’s project, we had to integrate Event kit framework in the project. Since we had never heard about it before, we had to first turn on ‘Research Mode’ and we found that, this framework is indeed useful for adding customization calendar in an iOS app. 

And after knowing all this, we thought to create a demo on it and written a tutorial to [Making a Calendar Event Reminder App Using Event Kit Framework](https://www.spaceotechnologies.com/make-calendar-event-reminder-app-event-kit-framework/).

If you face any issue implementing it, you can contact us for help. Also, if you want to implement this feature in your iOS app and looking to [hire iPhone app developer](http://www.spaceotechnologies.com/hire-iphone-developer/) to help you, then you can contact Space-O Technologies for the same.
